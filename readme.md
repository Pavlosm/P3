### Where is what

* All resources that are used in the forms like images and stylesheets are in the 
"public" directory.

* All views are in the "views" directory

* The logic for the routes is in the "controller" directory

* There is a class "RandomUser", which is used just to play around with classes 
and objects, which provides some different printing functionality.
